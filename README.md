#TrackCovid App

##My Project API
For this project the API I am goign to use is https://covid19api.com/

###Objective

The main goal of this application is to track the number cases for each country in the US
so that people can find the number of cases per country and then choose to travel to the safest 
country.

From this Application I am hoping to accomplish below results.

1. What countries are safest to travel depending the surging cases?
2. Find the number of cases that are incresing or decreasing during a specified period of time?
3. The option to search by an individual country so users can see how many people have recovered and total number of cases?

####Motivation

The reason behind why I am developing this application because now people have started travelling. As the travel 
restrictions are being lifted from one country to another country. From my application I am trying bring the most
updated information to users so that they may find and travel to safest country as per the data. By Application I 
am trying to get all the information that a user need at one spot which is my TrackCovid App.

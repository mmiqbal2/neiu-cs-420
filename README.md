# TrackCovid App

## My Project API
For this project, The API I am going to use is https://covid19api.com/

### Objective

The main goal of this application is to track the number of cases for each country so that people can find the number of cases for a respective country and then choose to travel to the safest country.

From this application I am hoping to accomplish below results.

1. What countries are safest to travel depending upon the surging cases?
2. Find the number of cases that are incresing or decreasing during a specified period of time?
3. The option to search by an individual country so users can see how many people have recovered and total number of cases?

#### Motivation

The reason behind why I am developing this application because now people have started travelling. As the travel 
restrictions are being lifted from one country to another country. From my application I am trying bring the most
updated information to users so that they may find and travel to safest country as per the data by my application.
I am trying to get all the information that a user need at one spot which is my TrackCovid App So the user will not 
have spend much time than necessary on deciding where they want to travel.
